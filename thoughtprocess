Understanding the Task: My first step was to carefully understand the task requirements. It seemed like I needed to analyze text data extracted from URLs, covering aspects such as sentiment, readability, and word count.
Selecting Tools: I chose the libraries and tools that best suited the task. Pandas was perfect for data manipulation, BeautifulSoup for web scraping, NLTK for text processing, and regular expressions for string manipulation.
Data Loading: I began by loading the dataset from an Excel file. This ensured that I had the necessary data to work with.
Web Scraping: I created a function to scrape relevant text data from the URLs provided in the dataset. This involved using requests to fetch HTML content and BeautifulSoup to parse and extract specific elements.
Text Preprocessing: I focused on cleaning the text data by converting it to lowercase, removing punctuation, and filtering out stop words. This step aimed to prepare the text for analysis.
Sentiment Analysis: I calculated positive and negative scores for each text using predefined lists of words. This allowed me to gauge the sentiment of the text.
Readability Calculation: I computed various readability metrics like the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Fog Index, and Average Sentence Length. These metrics provided insights into the complexity and readability of the text.
Additional Analysis: I performed additional tasks such as counting complex words, syllable counts per word, and identifying personal pronouns. These tasks enriched the analysis and provided further insights into the text data.
Data Output: Finally, I stored the processed data along with the calculated metrics in a CSV file.
